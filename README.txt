In search of the Holy Grail of Indiana, Jones faced a dangerous ordeal.
He needs to go through a rectangular corridor, which consists of fragile slabs
(recall a scene from the movie "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"). On each
one letter is written on the plate:
You can start with any plate in the leftmost column. There is an exit from the corridor
upper right and lower right plates (for example above - a and f).
Indiana is agile, and can not only jump to the next plate, but also jump
through several plates. However, in order not to fall through the floor, he must adhere to
such rules:
1. After each step, the Indian must be more right than he was before.
2. You can always go to one plate on the right.
3. In addition to moving one plate to the right, you can jump, but only on that
the letter itself. For example, you can jump from the letter a to any other
the letter a, provided that we move to the right in this course.
